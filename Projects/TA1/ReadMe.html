I went with a red black and white color scheme.
There is only one css page that handles the TA1 project.
There is another for my main page.
I tried to reflect some of the scheme from my main page onto the TA1 project pages.

I thought radio buttons would be an easy way to select only one course per application, 
I think that will help in the future with handeing the database. One class per application seems best.

I thought that asking for a grade would be a good way to check to see if the student took the class and was honest.

I like the thin black border.

I spent a good amount of time on playing with positioning things absolutely to try customize the look a little more.

It took me a while to get my VA machine up and running, the class forum helped a great deal on setting up VM and SVN. 

Thanks,
